===============

This repository has the material for my Python Workshop.  [Workshop-Flow.md](Workshop-Flow.md) contains the overall flow of the workshop.

The .ipynb files are IPython notebooks.  These will serve as a reference both for the presenters as well as the participants.  The notebooks can be viewed in the browser:
